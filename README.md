## flicd

React to flic button presses on the Raspberry Pi.

### Installation

The flicd server needs a bluetooth controller. If you are running [Hass.io based on HassOS](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2018/07/11/hassio-images/), you can use the built-in controller. If you are running the older [Hass.io based on ResinOS](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2018/07/11/hassio-images/), you'll need to install the [Bluetooth BCM43xx](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/bluetooth_bcm43xx/) add-on.

```
Available HCI devices found:
hci0
Trying hci0
hci0 is busy, shutting down and retrying...
Successfully bound HCI socket
Flic server is now up and running!
Initialization of Bluetooth controller done!
```

After starting the flicd add-on, you might need to restart Home Assistant.
Your flic buttons should be detected automatically if you keep pressing the button.

By default, flicd is going to use `hci0` bluetooth controller. If you have multiple bluetooth controllers you can configure flicd to use another controller by specifying it in `hci_dev` configuration setting of the add-on.

```
{
  "hci_dev": "hci1"
}
```
